# Welcome to Pop Shop üçø
In this exercise you will need to implement a successful call to Forter that includes the forterToken cookie.

We have set up a server that has everything you need besides the Forter snippet on the client side and four functions that need to be implemented on the server side.

## How to start
1. Fork this repo to your own account
2. Clone your copy of the repo to your computer
3. Make sure you have node js installed on your computer
4. In the repo directory, run `npm install` to install the server's dependencies
5. After the server is installed, run `npm start`
6. Open http://localhost:8080/

## What to do
Feel free to explore all the files in the repository.  
The Forter snippet needs to be added to [index.html](./static/index.html).  
The four functions that need implementation are in [server.js](./server.js).

__Good luck!__
